I am a PhD candidate in the [Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience Area](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/program-areas/cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience.html) of the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan. I am supported by a [Rackham Merit Fellowship](https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/funding-types/rackham-merit-fellowship-program/) and I collaborate with multiple research labs including the [Cognition, Control, and Action Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/tarazlee-lab/), the [Lanugage and Cognitive Architecture Lab](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rickl/), the [Cognitive Neuroimaging Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/jonides-lab/), and the [Basic and Applied Cognition Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/shah-lab/). 

I am broadly interested in how perceptual, affective, cognitive, and motor systems in the human brain interact to support goal-directed behavior. I am inspired by philosophical questions about free will and consciousness and I approach these topics with rigorous multi-modal experimentation and quantiative analysis. In practice, my research projects consist of precisely measuring and perturbing people's behavior and brain activity while they perform tasks engineered to recruit specific mental processes at specific times.

I have experience developing attitudinal, behavioral, and neurophysiological experiments (JavaScript/HTML), using Bayesian mathematical models to infer latent processes from small data (R, Stan), using complex machine learning models to predict future behavior from big data (Python), and communicating research methods and results in visualizations, talks, and scientific articles.   

I am actively seeking positions in data science and user research so that I can apply my technical skills and domain knowledge to the development of cutting-edge technologies.
