I am a Graduate Research Fellow in the [Cognition, Control, and Action Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/tarazlee-lab/), studying how incentives affect people's ability to learn and perform new skills. I am wrapping up my PhD in [Cognitive Neuroscience](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/program-areas/cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience.html) at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu). Previously, I worked as an RA in the [Lanugage and Cognitive Architecture Lab](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rickl/) and wrote my honors thesis in [Cognitive Science](https://lsa.umich.edu/weinberginstitute) on the role of attention in  voluntary action.
